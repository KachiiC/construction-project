If your fuse box is labelled, you can locate the affected circuit and try unplugging appliances on that circuit through a process of elimination. If you locate a faulty item, don't continue to use it and seek repair. If you can't locate a faulty appliance and are still experiencing issues, contact our team for further assistance. "
